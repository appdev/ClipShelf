# ClipDock Windows Panel — Changelog

## 0.2.0

The Windows panel graduates from a local-only UI shell into a persistent,
syncing clipboard client built on the shared `clipboard_core` engine.

### Added
- **Local persistence** — captured clipboard items (text and images) are
  stored in SQLite (schema v15, identical to macOS) and survive restarts.
- **Bidirectional sync** — create or join a sync space from Preferences; text
  captures push to the server and remote changes apply locally. Outbound and
  inbound both verified end to end against the real sync server.
- **Realtime delivery** — a `/v2/ws` WebSocket connection applies remote events
  within seconds, backed by a 15s HTTP poll loop as a safety net.
- **Image thumbnail sync** — captured images generate an adaptive WebP
  thumbnail that uploads to the server and propagates as an image event.
- **P2P discovery** — the device registers its endpoint with the server and can
  list peers in the sync space (direct iroh blob transfer is a later step).
- **System tray menu** — show/hide panel, sync now, preferences, copy
  diagnostics, and quit.

### Changed
- Backend now depends directly on `clipboard_core` rather than a bespoke
  storage schema, guaranteeing cross-platform parity.
- Preferences (including sync credentials) persist in the core database.

### Added (completing the sync feature set)
- **Live UI refresh on sync** — the panel reloads automatically when remote
  changes arrive, so synced items appear without a restart.
- **Inbound thumbnail display** — thumbnails for synced remote images are
  downloaded and shown as previews.
- **Full-resolution P2P image transfer** — full images transfer directly
  between devices over iroh-blobs. The transport now lives in the shared
  `clipdock_p2p` crate used by both macOS and Windows, and devices register
  their real iroh endpoint (reachable addresses) for discovery.
- **Accurate copy counts** — outbound events send the per-upload increment, so
  remote copy counts no longer drift on re-copy (schema v16).

### Known limitations
- A clean Windows `.exe`/`.msi` must be produced on a Windows machine/CI
  (cannot cross-build from macOS).
